## ðŸŽ« Introduction :
Cligo (aka CLI Go) is a Python-based free and open-source CLI (Command line interface)
Framework. Cligo makes it easier & faster to build CLI
application.

The main goal of CliGo is to allow developers to focus on building commands,
instead of worrying about the process, execution & user input handeling.

And with our built-in components you can easily do stuffs like `checking 
permissions` (e.g., checking if the user is logged in), 
`user information`, `Handeling errors`, `Handeling inputs`, `Database` and more.

With our continuous updates you will keep getting new components and
features.

## 🍰 Database

Now you might want your app to have a database to store data, there's many use cases
where a CLI app might need a database, like Storing cookies, keys, information and
more.

We use [peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee) for our database, it's an ORM
`(Object–relational mapping)` database. So why do we use peewee? what's special?

So there are lots of ORM database packages but peewee is the best one we have 
seen so far, so we chose to add peewee database for CliGo, and we have 
built-in methods that will help you work with peewee database easily.
So you can easily get started with it instead of figuring out how to configure, 
structure & work appropriately with CliGo.

We won't be covering everything about peewee right here, you can check out more
information & documentation about peewee [here](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee).

Here are some basic info to work with peewee 

Examples
--------

Defining models is similar to Django or SQLAlchemy:

```python
from peewee import *
import datetime


db = SqliteDatabase('my_database.db')

class BaseModel(Model):
    class Meta:
        database = db

class User(BaseModel):
    username = CharField(unique=True)

class Tweet(BaseModel):
    user = ForeignKeyField(User, backref='tweets')
    message = TextField()
    created_date = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)
    is_published = BooleanField(default=True)
```

Connect to the database and create tables:

```python
db.connect()
db.create_tables([User, Tweet])
```

Create a few rows:

```python
charlie = User.create(username='charlie')
huey = User(username='huey')
huey.save()

# No need to set `is_published` or `created_date` since they
# will just use the default values we specified.
Tweet.create(user=charlie, message='My first tweet')
```

Queries are expressive and composable:

```python
# A simple query selecting a user.
User.get(User.username == 'charlie')

# Get all user objects from the User model
users = [user for user in User.select()]
```

### 🧇 Peewee with CliGo

Now let's get into how we can use Cligo's peewee features, and work with cligo and
peewee. For this test case we will create a command that creates and retrieves object.

First lets create our model, we will create simple `User` model inside `models.py`

```python
from cligo.db import models


class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField()
```
first import the `models` file from `cligo.db` and your model should inherit from
`models.Model`, and specify the field type from `models` in this case
`username = models.CharField()`

Now in our `command.py`

```python
from models import User

class UserCommand(Command):

    def process(self, query):
        if query.lower() == 'create':
            username = input("Username: ")
            User.create(username=username)
            self.output('User object Created.')

        elif query.lower() == "all":
            self.output([user for user in User.select()])
```

in this command we can create and view our model objects. Now its time to configure
the database.


in `main.py`

```python
from cligo.cli import CliApp
from cligo.db.backends import SqliteDatabase

# You have to connect to the database first before importing the models
DATABASE = SqliteDatabase('my_database.db')
CliApp.config(DATABASE)

# Now you can import your models and other files
from models import User
from commands import UserCommand



app = CliApp("Testapp")

# registering the models
app.db.models.register([User])  # must be a list

app.register(UserCommand, command_name='user')

app.run()
```

Here Import your database backend from `cligo.db.backends`, in this case we will
use Sqlite database, and then we configured & connected to the database then
we imported the models and registered it. 

> ⚠ Note: You have to configure the database before you import your models or 
> commands / functions that refers to your models, unfortunately this is how 
> peewee works. If you try to import your models before configuring the database
> you will get errors.

At the end we have registered our models using `app.db.models.register()` the 
value must be a list.

Now let's run it.

```shell
python main.py user create
```

`output: `
```shell
Username: oniii-chaan

User object Created.
```

Now lets see all of our user objects

```shell
python main.py user all
```

`output: `

```shell
[<User: 1>]
```
And our database is working 🥳

But! The code in `main.py` looks messy right? doing a bunch of stuffs before 
importing other stuffs, And who doesn't like clean & structured code?

Let's clean & structure it. Create a file named `settings.py` (you can name it
anything it you want)

inside `settings.py`

```python
from cligo.cli import CliApp
from cligo.db.backends import SqliteDatabase

DATABASE = SqliteDatabase("my_database.db")
CliApp.config(DATABASE)
```

Set up your database inside this file now in `main.py` we can remove those
database config codes and just run this file, the easiest way to do this is
using python's built-in module `importlib`

im `main.py` 
```python
import importlib
importlib.import_module('settings')
from models import User
from commands import UserCommand


app = CliApp("Testapp")

app.db.models.register([User])

app.register(UserCommand, command_name='user')

app.run()
```
At First, we need to configure and connect to the database and thats why we need to
run `settings.py` first, using importlim you can run that file by 
`importlib.import_module('some/path/module')` NOTE: you don't need to specify the
`.py`, Just use the file name.

Now let's run it & see if it works or not.

```shell
python main.py user all
```

`output: `

```shell
[<User: 1>]
```

🎊🥳 Its working! now your code is clean & also structured.

## âš¡ Getting started :

Now we are going to start understanding the CliGo Framework
and create Some Commands.


### Installing Cligo :
```shell
pip install cligo
```

Cligo is print() driven, it's not like you are going to return a value, because
you will be printing / displaying values continuously.

Now we will create a CLI app togather, Let's get started.

* Go into your project folder and then let's create a python file named
`commands.py` and another file named `main.py`
  

inside `main.py`
```python
from cligo.cli import CliApp

app = CliApp("AppName")
```

now go inside `commands.py`. And let's start creating a login command.
```python
from cligo.command import Command


class Login(Command):
    
    def process(self, request, username, password):
        if username == "admin" and password == "pass123":
            print("Login successful.")
        else:
            print("Incorrect username & password.")
```
Our command class must inherit from cligo.command.Command and make sure to do 
the work inside process(), request is a required parameter, and username and password
is our required parameter. Now we need to register our command object.

go to `main.py`
```python
from cligo.cli import CliApp
from commands import Login


app = CliApp("AppName")

app.register(Login, command_name='login')
```
We have just imported our commands & registered our command. command_name is the name of the command and it will
be executed when we call it. Now let's run it.

in your `main.py` call app.run()
```python
from cligo.cli import CliApp
from commands import Login


app = CliApp("AppName")

app.register(Login, command_name='login')

app.run()
```

It's ready to go, let's run it. Open your terminal and run
```shell
python main.py login
```

```shell
output: You haven't fill out the required argument: <username>
```

since we haven't fill out those required parameters `username` and `password` it
gave us this message, Now let's fill those params

```shell
python main.py login admin pass123
```

```shell
output: Login successful.
```

Now let's try entering wrong cerdentials.

```shell
python main.py login john somepass
```

```shell
output: Incorrect username & password.
```

It's working as we expected ðŸ¥³

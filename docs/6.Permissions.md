## üîê Permissions :

Permissions is one of our built-in components that allows you to check for
permission before executing your command process() method.

Let's create a permission that ckecks if the user is logged in or not, if yes
then let it to continue

Let's Create a `permissions.py` file
```python
from cligo.permissions import BasePermission


class IsAuthenticated(BasePermission):

    def process(self):
        # do some stuffs...
        return True

    def on_permission_denied(self):
        print("Sorry, you are not authenticated. Permission denied.")
```

Your custom permission class must inherit from `cligo.permissions.BasePermission`

do your checks and logic inside `process(self)`  and then return a `bool`, for 
this test case we are just going to return True, this `process()`must return 
either True or False, if True then it will continue to execute your command else
it will run `on_permission_denied()` method.

Now let's apply this permission to our prevous command class `Add`

Go to your command file and import that permission class and add it to permissions list like below
```python
from cligo.command import Command
from permissions import IsAuthenticated


class Add(Command):
    
    permissions = [IsAuthenticated]
    
    def process(self):
        val_1 = input("value 1 : ")
        val_2 = input("value 2 : ")
        print(f'\nTotal: {int(val_1) + int(val_2)}')
```

That's it, now it will do its job accordingly. Let's try it with permission returns True

```shell
python main.py add
```

output : 
```shell
value 1 : 20
value 2 : 15

Total: 35
```

It's working, Now lets return False from `IsAuthenticated` permission process() method

```shell
python main.py add
```

```shell
output: Sorry, you are not authenticated. Permission denied.
```

Voila! it's working as expected üéâü•≥

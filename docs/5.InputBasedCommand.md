## 🥞 Input based command

Previously we have learned about arguments and keyword-argument based command.
But this is not always the case, in some cases you want to create manually 
input based command, so when you call them it will ask for your input. And you
don't need to use Argument or Keyword-argument based command. Let me show you.


We will create a `addition` command that takes input value from user and then
adds (+) it. Let's begin.

In `command.py` :
```python
from cligo.command import Command


class Add(Command):
    
    def process(self, request):
        val_1 = input("value 1 : ")
        val_2 = input("value 2 : ")
        print(f'\nTotal: {int(val_1) + int(val_2)}')
```

In `main.py`
```python
from cligo.cli import CliApp
from commands import Add

app = CliApp("AppName")

app.register(Add, command_name='add')

app.run()
```

Now let's give it a shot

```shell
python main.py add
```

```shell
value 1 : 20
value 2 : 15

Total: 35
```

Phew, That was easy 🐱‍👓

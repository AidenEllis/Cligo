## 🍪 Options

We may have seen commands like `someapp delete <some_file> --force`. Here`--force` 
is an option, and it's a boolean value which is defaulted to `False` and when you specify
the option in the command in turns `True`. Options are really helpful and cligo makes
it easier to use.


Let's create a command that deletes a file (even though we are not going to delete files)

in `commands.py`:
```python
from cligo.command import Command


class DeleteFile(Command):
    
    def process(self, filename: str):
        print(self.request.options)
    
    class Meta(Command.Meta):
        option_prefix = '--'
```

For now, we will print the options. You can access options by `self.request.options`
(type : `dict`). 

To activate options you need to specify `option_prefix` in your
command's Meta class. If any given command starts with the `option_prefix` it will be
counted as an option.


Let's give it a try

```shell
python main.py delete somefile.txt --force
```

```shell
Output: {options: {'force': True}}
```

Now lets access it from our command.

```python
    def process(self, filename: str):
        print(self.request.options.force)
        print(self.request.options.doesntexist)
```

First we are going to print the `force` option and then some option that doesn't exist.

To access the option you can access it with `.` like `request.options.someOption` or
`request.options['someOption']` or `request.options.get('someOption')` just like a 
dictionary.

Let's run our command

```shell
python main.py delete somefile.txt --force
```

```shell
Output: True
        False
```

Here we specified the `force` option, and we got the value `True` but we didn't specify
the `doesntexist` option that's why we got the value `False`.

> NOTE: If you also have `kwarg_prefix` specified in your command, make sure the `kwarg_prefix`
> and the `option_prefix` are NOT the same.

## ‚≠ê Extra Arguments & Keyword Arguments :

Previously we have talked about Keyword arguments, where we refer to an argument
using keyword (e.g : `-u` refers to `username`)

### Extra Arguments :

Now there might be cases where you want to allow extra arguments in your command
method.

using our previous command class if we insert extra argument in input we would
get `UnexpectedvalueError`


previously in `main.py`
```python
from cligo.command import Command


class Login(Command):
    
    def process(self, request, username, password):
        if username == "admin" and password == "pass123":
            self.output("Login successful.")
        else:
            self.output("Incorrect username & password.")
    
    class Meta(Command.Meta):
        param_keywords = {
            'username': '-u',
            'password': '-p',
        }
```

let's see what happens to it if we use extra arguments on our previous code
```shell
python `main.py` login admin pass123 extraArg
```

```shell
output: Command <login> got unexpected value 'extraArg'
```

Now if you want your command class method to accept extra arguments (`non-keyword`), in your command process method add
`*args `. This is how we also would do generally in python function.

```python
class Login(Command):
    
    def process(self, request, username, password, *args):
```
Now your command will accept extra arguments. Let's give it a try

```shell
python main.py login admin pass123 extraArg
```

```shell
output: Login successful.
      args: ['extraArg']
```

ü•≥ It's working, and you can access those extra arguments in your command process()
`args` parameter.

### Extra keyword arguments :
There might also be cases where you want to allow extra keyword-arguments in your
command, using our previous command code it would give us an `UnexpectedvalueError`
error.

If you want your command to accept extra keyword arguments, then you need to set `kwarg_prefix`
in Meta class and add `**kwargs` parameter in your process method :

```python
class Login(Command):
    
    def process(self, request, username, password, **kwargs):
```

```python
    class Meta(Command.Meta):
        kwarg_prefix = '-'
```

`kwarg_prefix` is the prefix that identifies your kwarg like ('-u', '-p') here
the prefix is '-', if you enter something with `-` at the start of it, it will
take it as a keyword.

Let's try it.

```shell
python main.py login admin pass123 -x myExtraArg
```

```shell
output: Login successful.
        Kwargs: {'x': 'myExtraArg'}
```

### Both args and kwargs
If you want both args and kwargs, then add `*args` & `**kwargs` in your
command process() method and also set your prefix in Meta class, and then
you can use both.
